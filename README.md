## UX - Visual Design

### 1. Wireframes

### 2. Color Palette 

![](assets/images/colorpalette.webp)

<img style="margin: 20px" align="left" width="300" height="300" src="assets/images/profileimage.webp"> <br>

### Why Violet?

Originally, a single aesthetically pleasing colour ( #9256f6) was chosen for use on button hovers, clicks, links and for use in some titles. The reason that a violet hue was selected for the portfolio website is because it has a direct relationship with Kim's use of ultra-violet light in her art exhibitions - the color itself carries meaning, and tells a story about Kim's artwork. From this base color two secondary violet hues ( #a781f1 and #5f18ea) were selected to account for accessibility and contrast criteria. An artistic 'flower petal' shaped border on Kim's profile image on the [about](https:/kimjev-webdev.github.io/Unit1/about.html) page makes use of all 3 violet tones, next to segments of the pattern which forms the background on the [contact](https:/kimjev-webdev.github.io/Unit1/contact.html) page. The profile image border, therefore, draws together all of the colors used across the site which prevents the use of #5f18ea on white background, and use of #a781f1 on black backgrounds looking hapchance, and instead makes the selection a concious style choice which is WCAG compliant.

<br>

### 3. Icons

A combination of icons from the FontAwesome library have been utilized in the navbar, footer and contact page (after form submission). As well as stock icons, several custom icons were created and used for the navbar branding and amongst social icons in the footer. 

<img style="margin: 20px" align="left" width="600" src="assets/images/faicons.webp"> <br> This selection of icons from the Font Awesome library are styled with a combination of Bootstrap's inline styling and custom CSS which targets custom classes applied to the  tag. Font Awesome's own [literal sizing scale](https://docs.fontawesome.com/web/style/size) is also utilized inline to scale the icons. 

 <img style="margin: 20px" align="right" width="250" src="assets/images/facustom.webp"><br><br>
Two custom icons were created using SVG files uploaded to the Font Awesome library. This allows the brand 'badge' logo in the navbar to be targetted and styles in the same method as the other icons. A second custom icon displays Kim's full logo in the footer, to cement the brand identity she has developed throughout her art career. The logo is a registered trademark.

### 4. Fonts 

#### Primary Font - Rumei House

Rumei House was purchased under lisence from [MyFonts.com](https://www.myfonts.com/collections/rumei-house-font-imoodev?srsltid=AfmBOorYh8r2v8qMe3nCv5gwRjpZThU-3WT1UXSih-AlNUYzToOGvVYH)

A psychedelic, maximalist, and very stylized font was chosen for headings and buttons for several reasons.
* It clearly represents aspects of Kim's artistic style and therefore compliments the content of the website.
* When capitalized the font fits into a 'box shape' which makes it intuitivley identifiable as a button. 
* The box-like letters also allow the text to look aesthetically pleasing when justified. 
<br>
<br>
 <img style="margin: 20px" align="left" width="300" src="assets/images/nametext.webp">
Graphic images of text elements were used on the carousel overlay text and on the about page to work around alignment complications. CSS text justification properties ('text-justify: justified') is only applicable when text is overspilling onto the next line, and even with several other style adjustments in place the desired outcome was complicated to achieve. 

Due to time constraints and current skill levels it made more sense to apply images in place of the text elements. (See preview left) The images all contain alt-text which matches the writing displayed in the image. 

The user is familiarised with the 'Rumei House' font representing 'clickable content' through its use in the navbar, a conventional element on most websites. After learning through the use of the font in this location, combined with a hover effect on the menu items, it becomes clear that any text in Rumei House font which displays a purple hover color is likely to be a button. This eliminates confusion which could be caused by the lack of outline and background that is a usual style convention of buttons. The 'call to action' placements also solidify that text displayed in Rumei House is usually a button. 

The discerning quality between RumeinHouse being used as headers and as buttons is the size along with the hover color (see preview below) - a clear size difference between elements displayed on similiar pages notifies users that one aspect is a title, and the other is a button.

Rumei House has been capitalized wherever it is used across the site. 

![](assets/images/overlayps.webp)

<img style="margin: 20px" align="right" width="400" height="auto" src="assets/images/montserratprev.webp">

#### Secondary Font - Montserrat

Montserrat Font was chosen and uploaded from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Montserrat) for several reasons.
* Sans-serif makes it easy to read across all devices.
* The letterforms are curvy which means they compliment the 'flowing' forms of Rumei House. 
* Montserrat has clean, geometric letterforms which make it feel modern and structured.
* It is offered in a wide range of weights, from thin to bold which makes it easy to style.  
* It has tall uppercase letters which make it look effective when capitalised.    

Everywhere that Montserrat is used on the website it is styled to be capitalized apart from on the about page where the largest bodies of text are located. This is to ensure that the paragraphs are easy to read.  This keeps the text looking punchy and to the point. Minimal text is used where possible and so Montserrat can really only found in the footer, in placeholders on the contact form and, as mentioned, in the paragraphs on the about page. See preview >

### 5. Images
![](assets/images/gallerypreview.webp)

The images selected for the site should provide a visual overview of Kim's experience as an artist, as well as a clear idea of her visual language and style. The gallery hosts pictures of Kim's surface pattern designs and creative direction for fashion photography, her textile banners, her mixed-media artwork, art exhibitions and illustration which shows a dynamic approach to creativity.  

* Images are a combination of photographs and mockups of Kim's work which help to give a clear and concise layout to the gallery.
* 3 responsive columns are used to give a basic masonry style effect. 
* All images are high quality, and therefore have large file sizes. To aid loading times all images were compressed.
* All images are uploaded in 'webp' format to aid UX and provide superior lossless and lossy compression to the images in the gallery.
* Lazy loading (loading="lazy") was used to improve UX.
* With more time and experience the gallery would benefit from [Blur Hash](https://blurha.sh/) implementation to improve UX.
* With more time and experience the gallery would benefit from other feature such as zoom hover or displaying in larger format when clicked. 

6. ### Styling
Across the site Bootstrap 5 and Custom CSS are used interchangably to achieve the desired styles. As an absaloute beginner, the methods of achieving style results were largly trial and error and a lot of experimentation. In some cases, styling could have been achieved through Bootstrap inlinek, which would have saved some time, but for the sake of learning, using the custom CSS to target elements has achieved the same results and added a depth of understanding. 

## Features - All Pages

### 1. Navbar

![](assets/images/navfull.webp)
The navbar was created from a [boilerplate](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/navbar/) copied from Bootstrap 5 and then customized. 

<img style="margin: 20px;" align="right" width="400px" height="auto" src="assets/images/navcollapse.webp" >

* The navbar is as simple as possible to aid the UX. 
* 3 pages with clear and obvious headings make the site easy to navigate.
* The navbar uses Rumei House font for links.
* The left hand side of the navbar has the badge version of Kim's logo. This operates as a homepage link to aid navigation.
* The badge logo has been implemented as a custom icon, created and uploaded to Font Awesome.
* The navbar is responsive and collapsible utilizing the universal 'hamburger' icon on smaller devices. > See preview
* Bootstrap's navbar toggler icon (hamburger for collapsible responsive menu) has been replaced with a Font Awesome alternative which makes it easier to target with CSS, including adding the purple hover effect.
* All buttons in the navbar have this purple rollover.
* The navbar uses 'sticky-top' to keep it visible on even when the page is scrolled down. 


### 2. Footer 
![](assets/images/footerfull.webp)

<img style="margin: 20px;" align="right" width="300" height="auto" src="assets/images/footerjs.webp">

The footer is located at the bottom of every page, and was created from a [boilerplate](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/components/card/#header-and-footer) provided by Bootstrap 5.

* The footer is responsive, forming 3 columns on larger screens and on smaller devices it collapses into one column. 
* There is an empty column nested within the footer to help assist in aligning the central column despite the aysmetrical widths of the two outside columns. 
* The footer includes an email sign up 'call to action' which utilizes placeholder text to explain to the user that they are signing up for a newsletter.
* The email sign up uses JavaScript to change the SIGN UP button text to THANKS! Which allows the user to understand that the form has been submitted without taking up extra space. This whole column is designed to be as comprehensive as possible without comprimising UX.
* The 'SIGN UP' button on the email sign up is greyed out to communicate that the email hasn't been entered and this transitions to white once it has been filled in. 
* The central column includes social links encouraging users to stay connected and find out more about Kim.
* The final column contains the page navigation links which aid site navigation. 
* There is space in the final column for a PRIVACY section to contain the privacy policy once this has been created.

## Features - Homepage 

![](assets/images/carouseloverlaypreview.webp)

The homepage serves a strong, visually impactful set of imagery to intrigue users, with its purpose being to capture their attention and lead them 'deeper' into the website's content. 

### 1. Hero/Carousel

<center>
<img style="margin: 5px" width="300" height="auto" src="assets/images/portfoliohero1.webp">
<img style="margin: 5px" width="300" height="auto" src="assets/images/portfoliohero2.webp">
<img style="margin: 5px" width="300" height="auto" src="assets/images/portfoliohero3.webp">
</center>

The Hero imagery on the homepage is the first visual introduction to Kim's artwork on the site. 

* It welcomes users by providing visually exciting snapshots of 3 different artworks in different mediums.
* The first image contains green tones and binary notations to act as a visual connection between Kim's art & her web development.
* The images display in a slideshow format automatically which is aided by JavaScript and automatically switches between the images.
* The hero images in the carousel span the entire viewport width to serve an impact and give strong visual ques to the user.

### 2. Image Text & Overlay

![](assets/images/overlayps.webp)

The image text on the carousel 'teases' more information about the content of the website and supports the content of the hero imagery in the carousel. 

* The image text is in webp image format to help style the text in a justified format with multiple text sizes on each line. 
* The text is responsive, on mobiles it is in a box shape format to work with the vertical profile, and on larger screens it is in a longer line to give visual appeal the horizontally wider dimensions. 
* The image text is styles in Rumei House
* The button below the image text is also in Rumei House font.
* The text for the button is smaller and on rollover and click it shows a purple color.
* The text on the button 'Learn More' indicates to the users that it can be clicked to navigate to another page. 
* The button navigates to the 'About' page - the first page in the navigation to guide users through the site.
* There is a semi transparent, dark overlay which makes the text more distinguishable.
* The overlay is permenant on handheld devices to aid the user experience as there is no mouse to hover the users on mobiles will be relying on touch. 
* The overlay is activated by hovering over the hero images on desktops as the using a mouse allows for this. 


## Features - About Page

![](assets/images/aboutpreview.webp)

The [about](https://kimjev-webdev.github.io/Unit1/about.html) page features a visually enticing responsive design which forms a single column on mobiles, expanding to two columns on tablets and on larger screens it reveals a hidden third column.

### 1. Images

<img style="margin: 20px" align="left" width="auto" height="600" src="assets/images/abouttext.webp">

* There are 3 images on the About page - 2 show on devices up to size medium, and 3 showing on larger screens.
* Two images show text and follow the same format as the justified text seen on the carousel overlay for consistency.
* For the same reasons images of text were used rather than text (justification issues).
* The first image displays the text 'My name is Kim' which acts as a visual introduction to the information in the following paragraph.
* The second image, the profile image, gives a personal touch to the text information, supporting the friendly and relaxed introduction in the first image.
* The profile image displays a variety of violet hues and a pattern in a flower shaped border which ties together the stylistic elements used across the entire site. 
* The final image only displays on larger screens and helps the content of the first two columns on the page look more aesthetically pleasing. It says 'its great to meet you' which again, adds personality and friendly tones to the information which could otherwise be quite serious and mundane. 
* The images with text use Rumei House, justified to fit into the widths of the container they occupy. Key words are highlighted in the mid purple tone #9256f6 which helps draw the users eyes to the most important words 'Kim & Great' - which gives a positive message about her to potential employers and collaborators. 

<img style="margin: 20px" align="right" width="auto" height="300" src="assets/images/nametext.webp">

<br>

### 2. Paragraphs

* The first paragraph serves to inform users a little more about Kim's aspirations in becoming a web developer and why her artistic background is a good device for this career change. This paragraph serves the main business objective and is targetted at the key user group.
* The second paragraph adds a little more in depth information about Kim's artwork, as she does not have a web development portfolio yet it aims to express her strengths and invite users to learn more about her creative skills. It targets other users who are less crucial than potential employers or recruiters. 

### 3. Buttons

<center>
<img style="margin: 20px" width="auto" height="100" src="assets/images/artbuttonprev.webp">
<img style="margin: 20px" width="auto" height="100" src="assets/images/cvbuttonprev.webp">
</center>

* The buttons help assist the user in gaining more relevant information, if the content of the paragraphs is of interest to them.
* At the base of the first paragraph is the button 'Download C.V' which provides a direct download to a PDF which will give recruiters and employers more in depth proffesional information about Kim
* This downloadable C.V prevents the about page from looking cluttered, and also allows the information to only be provided to people who require it.
* The button at the base of the second paragraph helps guide users to the next page in the navigation 'Gallery' - it says 'View my Artwork' and helps users follow a natural progression - once they have 'got to know' Kim on the about page, they can see a lot more visual information about her in the gallery. 
* Buttons utilize the darker violet #5f18ea on rollover to maintain WCAG on the white background of the about page. 

## Features - Gallery

![](assets/images/galleryresponsive.webp)

### 1. Images

Images in the gallery aim to showcase Kim's experiences as an artist, showcasing her dynamic design skills and justifying the stylistic choices made for the web design of her portfolio. The gallery is the anchoring point of the site which acts as a portfolio whilst Kim works on building a web-development project collection which can be added to this site at a later date.

* Images in the gallery are presented in a single column on small screens, and expand into 3 columns on larger screens.
* In order to mimic a masonry style gallery without JavaScript implementation images with 4:5 aspect ratio occupy the outside columns, whilst images with a 5:4 ration occupy the middle column. 
* Images have been resized to a maximum width of 800 pixels, as there is no way of 'zooming in' on them, they take up the width of an average phone screen whilst assisting in loading times.
* Nearly all images use 'lady-loading' with the exception of the top two images on the gallery to aid performance.
 
### 2. Icons

* A single icon is used on the gallery page - an up arrow, which aims to help users navigate back to the top of the gallery once they reach the bottom. 
* This arrow is a secondary option to the fixed-top navigation, should the user want to look back through the gallery rather than navigate to a different page. 

## Features - Contact Page

![](assets/images/contactpreview.webp)

### 1. Background Image

The background image is the final visual 'wow' that aims to ensure website users want to reach out and connect with Kim.

* The background image of the Contact page is a segment of one of Kim's surface patterns designs.
* The background image design is also featured in some of the 'petals' surrounding the profile photo on the about page.
* The image has been selected due to its complimentary tones that work well with the violet hues used for rollovers and buttons.
* The background image provides more visually exciting content which elevates the simple form layout on the page.

### 2. Form 

* The form has a large scale header in Rumei House font which gives it a design contingency between the other pages.
* The form uses a semi-transparent, dark background to give synergy between the overlay used on the index page. 
* The form has curved corners to match with the images in the gallery before it. 
* The form is designed to help users be specific about their enquiry, so at a later date these inquiries can be answered in order of relevance. (Users can select the nature of the query from a drop down list)
* The form has some required fields and others that are optional. 
* JavaScript has been implimented so that on form submission a secondary window appears which includes Kim's direct email should the user want to reach out in more detail.
* The language used in headers 'Get in touch' and 'Speak Soon' aims to inform users but also maintain the relaxed communication that is used in headers on the about page.
